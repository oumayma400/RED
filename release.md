## Notable updates
- content assist can search for patterns inside proposals (eg. searching for "og" will return "log" keyword)
- content assist can return Keywords when searching for capital letters (eg. activating content assist and writing LM will return Log Many)
- content assist now provides keywords from libs which are not included in TestSuite but available in project (entry in Referenced libraries in red.xml)
- debug is more aware which file it showing, this relates to cases when suite names are not unique within project. Debug also can check if debug run in robot is consistent to suite file being displayed.Covered in #111
- table editors should preserve empty lines and show duplicated sections. Still there is some work to do though.
- variable mappings can use already mapped variables to resolve values.Item covered in #120 
- more detailed progress bar for Automatically discover libraries from Robot Framework right-click menu
- top level entries (libraries) in library discovery summary report is now copy-able.This allows to copy libs names and install missing libraries to Robot
- filenames in tabs above editor can be prepanded with parent folder.Useful if filenames are not uniques in Project. Enabled by preference
- when setting Robot nature to Project, red.xml is not overwritten by default - proper user action is proposed


## GitHub issues updates

- #118 - use preference for content assistant trigger - now Content Assist trigger key (CTRL+space) is no longer hardcoded,it can be defined in preferences
- #120 - variable mapping could use already mapped vars in consecutive entries - implemented
- #122 - red.xml charsets issues - encoding of red.xml is no in UTF-8
- #128 - better handle projects without red.xml - for now,projects without red.xml can use Robot and system variables. Handling built-in libs will be done later. 
- #138 - do not override existing red.xml file

## Short term plans
- Usability improvements & comments formatting in table editors


## Notes
By default, Eclipse is shipped with limited heap size which impacts performance while working with bigger projects. It is recommended to increase Xmx and Xmx parameters to higher values. Memory allocation can be done via startup arguments or by editing eclipse.ini in Eclipse folder.
We recommend to set following lines to eclipse.ini :
```
-vmargs
-Xms512m
-Xmx1024m
```
For details visit Eclipse Wiki: https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_increase_the_heap_size_available_to_Eclipse%3F

## Feedback
We would appreciate any feedback about RED - Robot Editor, especially in every day functions like editors usability, false positive validation errors, problem with source parsing& coloring, performance etc. We are open for improvements and new functionalities. Fell free to create issue in GitHub issue tracker.

## Known issues
- Under Ubuntu/Xubuntu it was discovered that NullPointerException is shown when opening file from Project Explorer and clicking on file structure instead of file name. As a workaround open file by clicking on filename. 
- Cannot delete library by right click of mouse in red.xml under Ubuntu/Mint. Use Delete key as workaround
- GTK3 seems to mess up with Eclipse under Linux. Force usage of GTK2 by executing command in terminal: export SWT_GTK3=0
- Eclipse does not have UTF-8 support in editors by default. Check Preferences and RED help to get how to change it. 

## Short term plans
- Usability improvments
